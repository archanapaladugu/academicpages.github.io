My Work

1. At Doosan, we use AI to make green energy tech competitive in the marketplace and reliable for our customers. My personal focus is root cause analysis of failures in the field and anomoly detection for preventative maintenance of our power plants.
2. At WizKids, our EdTech startup, we built a platform that hosts leactures by great professors in India (like Coursera). It has since been acquired by Avantel India. 
3. At Arizona State University, I was part of the team that scaled up our online education curriculum offerings during our growth phase. I worked in the front end as a lecturer and on the backend on analytics providing a feedback to the instructors. 
4. At Arizona State University (ASU), I got my PhD in Vision and Comuting lab under Professor Baoxin Li. We used computer vision to enhance accessiblity for individuals with visual impairment.
