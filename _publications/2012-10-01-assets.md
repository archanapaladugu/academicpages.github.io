excerpt: 'A system that generates a verbal description combined with a user-friendly interface can be very useful in helping the user to get a sense of relative positions of locations and thus might reduce the need for totally relying on “asking for directions”. '

People with visual impairment can face numerous challenges navigating a new environment. A practical need is to navigate through unfamiliar indoor environments such as school buildings, hotels, etc., for which commonly-used existing tools like canes, seeing-eye dogs and GPS devices cannot provide adequate support. We demonstrate a prototype system that aims at addressing this practical need. The input to the system is the name of the building/establishment supplied by a user, which is used by a web crawler to determine the availability of a floor map on the corresponding website. If available, the map is downloaded and used by the proposed system to generate a verbal description giving an overview of the locations of key landmarks inside the map with respect to one another. Our preliminary survey and experiments indicate that this is a promising direction to pursue in supporting indoor navigation for the visually impaired.
