Assembly language programming, including input/output programming and exception/interrupt handling. Register-level computer organization, I/O interfaces, assemblers, and linkers. Motorola-based assignments.

Pre-reqs
======
The official prerequisite is CSE 100 (or 110 or 200) and CSE120/EEE120 Digital design fundamentals. By topics I expect you have
1. Programming skill in a high-level language (C, C++, Java or Pascal), including arrays and indexing, looping, data types, record structures, procedures, conditional and case (switch) branching.
2. Binary, octal, hexadecimal, ASCII data representations.
3. Two's-complement arithmetic.
4. Introductory Boolean logic and minimization techniques.
5. Building blocks of digital circuits, AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates, full adder, multiplexor, and decoder.
